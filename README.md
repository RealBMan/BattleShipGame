# BattleShipGame
This is a modified game of Battle ship created using processing programming language. In this version the player plays a digital version of the classic board game against a simple AI 
game system where the level of the game AI varies based on the game mode: easy, medium and hard. The game also keeps track of the player and their score and displays the last played player's name and score.
